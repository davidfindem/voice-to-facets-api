## ðŸ”„ **Complete Workflow**

### **Step 1: Chrome Extension Uploads Candidates**
```javascript
// Chrome extension sends candidate data
POST /api/candidates/upload
{
  "candidates": [
    {"name": "Todd Kurtz", "jobTitle": "Software Engineer", ...},
    {"name": "Kyle Scharnhorst", "jobTitle": "Product Manager", ...}
  ],
  "source": "Chrome Extension v7.2",
  "pageUrl": "https://app-next.findem.ai/...",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T16:45:00.000Z"
}
```

### **Step 2: ElevenLabs Sends Voice Command**
```javascript
// ElevenLabs sends voice text to your API
POST /api/voice-commands
{
  "voiceText": "Shortlist Todd Kurtz and Kyle Scharnhorst",
  "source": "ElevenLabs"
}
```

### **Step 3: OpenAI Processes Voice Command**
```javascript
// Your API uses OpenAI to interpret the voice command
// Returns structured actions:
{
  "interpretation": "User wants to shortlist Todd Kurtz and Kyle Scharnhorst",
  "actions": [
    {"type": "shortlist", "action": "add", "candidateName": "Todd Kurtz", "confidence": 0.95},
    {"type": "shortlist", "action": "add", "candidateName": "Kyle Scharnhorst", "confidence": 0.95}
  ]
}
```

### **Step 4: Chrome Extension Gets Commands**
```javascript
// Chrome extension polls for pending commands
GET /api/candidates/commands/pending
// Returns:
{
  "commands": [
    {"id": "cmd_123", "candidateName": "Todd Kurtz", "action": "add", ...},
    {"id": "cmd_124", "candidateName": "Kyle Scharnhorst", "action": "add", ...}
  ]
}
```

### **Step 5: Chrome Extension Executes Commands**
```javascript
// Extension clicks shortlist buttons and reports back
POST /api/candidates/commands/report
{
  "commandId": "cmd_123",
  "success": true,
  "message": "Todd Kurtz shortlisted successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T16:45:30.000Z"
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Testing Your Enhanced API**

### **Test 1: Check Your Original Endpoint Still Works**
```bash
curl https://voice-to-facets-api.vercel.app/api/voice-commands
# Should return: {"commands":[],"timestamp":"..."}
```

### **Test 2: Check New Candidate Endpoints**
```bash
curl https://voice-to-facets-api.vercel.app/api/candidates
# Should return API info with all endpoints listed
```

### **Test 3: Test Voice Processing with OpenAI**
```bash
curl -X POST https://voice-to-facets-api.vercel.app/api/voice-commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"voiceText": "Hello test"}'
# Should process with OpenAI (if candidates are uploaded)
```

## ðŸ”— **ElevenLabs Integration**

### **Configure ElevenLabs to Send Voice Commands**
Set up ElevenLabs to send HTTP POST requests to:
```
https://voice-to-facets-api.vercel.app/api/voice-commands
```

With payload:
```json
{
  "voiceText": "{{VOICE_TEXT}}",
  "source": "ElevenLabs",
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "{{TIMESTAMP}}",
    "confidence": "{{CONFIDENCE}}"
  }
}
```
